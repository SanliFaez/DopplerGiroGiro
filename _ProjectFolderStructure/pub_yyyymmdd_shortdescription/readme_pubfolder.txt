# readme for manuscript {publication nickname} 

This folder contains:

+ backup of the manuscript or link to the overleaf project
+ figures including python scripts uses for creating those
+ other material necessary for submission (support info, abstract, etc.)


## Good practices: 

+ Create a parent folder for figures and one python script or illustration file for each subfigure
+ Give your filenames a recognisable name
+ For multi-panel figures, try to create them within the script and not in illustrator
+ use matplotlib as much as possible, for illustrations use Adobe illustrator
+ store the datapoints for each figure as numpy arrays with clear description of which raw data they correspond to. This will accelerate finishing touches to plots.
