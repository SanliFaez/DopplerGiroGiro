# Master readme for {Project name} 

This folder contains:

+ measurement routines including code
+ analysis code
+ raw data that is used for some form of publication
+ processed measurements used for publications
+ structured files for manuscripts


## Conventions 

We use the following prefixes to separate different types of files.

+ raw_: raw data related to one of the publications including 
+ try_: temporary analysis of raw data files for intermediate communications 
+ pub_: definite analysis of raw data that is connected to a potential publication
+ usr_: content of these folders are maintained by an *individual* user (only if absolutely necessary)


## Good practices: 

+ Customise and include readme.txt and other guideline files in every subfolder.
+ Stick to the 5-minutes rule: from each plot, it should take less than 5 minutes to trace back the data and analysis code used for generating the plot
+ For large data-bundles create a subfolder
+ Use the convention: prefix_yyyymmdd_shortdescription
+ Add a new folder for each separate subproject and data of different type
+ For measurements that take multiple days, use the date of the first measurement in the parent folder
